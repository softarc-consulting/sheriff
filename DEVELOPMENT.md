Sheriff consists of three processes:

1. File Graph: `traverseFilesystem` gets and entry file and returns a graph of all the files that are required to run
   the entry file. The final type of the graph is `UnassignedFileInfo`, meaning graph without modules.
2. Modules: Based on `FileInfo`, `createModules` detects the existing modules and their dependencies. The final type of
   the modules is `ModuleInfo`.
3. Merging FileGraph and Modules: `FileInfo` is the final type of the graph that contains all the information about the
   files and modules. It is done by

The entry point is always the `init` function.


## Run local integration tests

We can use Sheriff locally against the projects in the `test-projects`-folder in order to verify that the tool works as
expected. The following steps are required to run the tests:

1. **Build Sheriff**: `yarn build:all`
2. **Link Sheriff**: `yarn link:sheriff`
3. **Run the integration tests**: Execute one of the `integration-test.sh`-scripts within the tests projects or run all by executing the `run-integration-tests.sh`.
