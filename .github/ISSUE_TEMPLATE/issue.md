If you have a question or need to report a bug, here are a few ways you can help us:

- Try reproducing the issue in **StackBlitz**. You can use our starter project here:  
  [Sheriff StackBlitz Starter](https://stackblitz.com/github/softarc-consulting/sheriff-stackblitz-starter).
- If the issue is related to your setup and you're allowed to share your application's structure (only import statements and filenames), please attach your `sheriff.config.ts` along with the output of:  

```sh
sheriff export
```
This will help us diagnose and resolve issues more efficiently. ðŸš€
